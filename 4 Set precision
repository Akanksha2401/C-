/*Learning to be precise 
There are times when your answer is a floating point that contains undesired amount of digits after decimal. Here, we'll learn how to get a precise answer out of a floating number. You are given two floating numbers a and b. You need to output a/b and decimal precision of a/b upto 3 places after the decimal point.

Note: You may use setprecision and fixed.

Input Format:
First line of input conatins number of testcases T. For each testcase, there will be one line of input containing a and b separated by a space.

Output Format:
For each testcase, print the required output.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= a, b,<= 100

Input:
1
